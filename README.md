Acceptance Criteria
* Users are able to submit contracts and payments to the API
* Users are able to retrieve contracts and payments that they submitted
* Users are able to retrieve the amount due for each contract they have
     * Amount due is how much they still have to pay for a contract
     * You must consider the interest rate and all payments made
* Users cannot see contracts/payments submitted by other users
* Use of the API requires a unique auth token for each user
* Submitted contracts must include, at least, the following attributes:
    * Identifier - an autogenerated random identifier for the contract
    * Amount - the amount owed to the bank
    * Interest rate - the monthly interest rate of the contract
    * IP Address - IP of the contract submitter
    * Submission date - the date the contract was submitted
    * Bank - information about the bank for which the money is owed, can be simple text (e.g., name,  tax id, etc.) or a separate model altogether
    * Customer Metadata - information about the individual that owes the money, can be simple text (e.g., name, email, tax id, etc.) or a separate model altogether
* Submitted payments must include, at least, the following attributes:
    * Contract identifier
    * Payment date
    * Payment amount
Optional: 
* Provide an authenticated admin view that allows me to view all contracts

Organize the schema and data models in whatever manner you think makes the most sense and feel free to add any additional style and flair to the project that you'd like.
